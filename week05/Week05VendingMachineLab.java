		 *  Vending Machine:
		 *
		 *   Create the following four classes:  VendingMachine, ItemSlot, Item, and Return
		 *
		 * 			a. VendingMachine: will contain a Map<String, ItemSlot> where 
		 *								the String will represent the location in the 
		 *								vending machine (i.e. "A4") 
		 *
		 * 			b. ItemSlot:  will contain an item, the item's price, and 
		 *								the quantity of that item in that slot 
		 *
		 * 			c. Item:  will contain a description 
		 *
		 * 			d. Return:  will have a field for an Item and a double for any change. 
		 * 								The Return is what will be returned 
		 *								to each user using the vending machine.
		 *
		 *   VendingMachine should have two methods:
		 *
		 *			a. a method that takes a double (money) and a location (i.e. "A4") 
		 *					and returns a Return containing any change and the item.
		 *					If the supplied money was insufficient to purchase the item, 
		 *					the Return should contain just the money (item should be null).
		 *
		 * 			b. a method that takes an Item, int (quantity), price and string (location) 
		 *					and will create an ItemSlot based on the input.
